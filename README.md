# Watercooler
A GameMaker modding tool based on UndertaleModLib, built with mod merging in mind.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Watercooler is **very incomplete.** Most features are not yet implemented, and the source has only been published because members of the DELTAModders Discord community wanted to contribute to the project. Watercooler is not yet suitable for maintaining your mod projects. The standard will very likely be changed multiple times before release, which is why we don't recommend using the tool as of now.
